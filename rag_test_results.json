This principle supports the company's mission as stated in the Corporate Plan by ensuring that confidential information related to defence projects is protected from unauthorized access, damage, or interference.\n\nIn particular, the \"Need-to-Know\" principle ensures that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive and classified information, which aligns with the company's commitment to protecting its people, information, and assets. This principle also supports the company's goal of achieving ISO 27001 certification, as it demonstrates a robust approach to information security management.\n\nBy enforcing the \"Need-to-Know\" principle, the company can ensure that its personnel are aware of their security obligations and empowered to identify and report security concerns without fear of reprisal. This proactive approach to security contributes to the company's overall mission of delivering secure and resilient communication solutions to the Australian Defence Force and our allies.",

This document formally defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the Aegis-Link Control Software.\n\nIn particular, we can find the requirement for initiating a BIT in section 5.1 of SS-AEG-SRS-001:\n\nREQ-FUN-005: Initiate Hydra-C4 BIT TC-CONTROL-01\n\nThis requirement is formally defined in the SRS document and is intended to be verified through testing.\n\nSo, to answer your question, the parent document that formally defines the requirement for the software to have this capability (initiating a Built-In Test) is SS-AEG-SRS-001: Aegis-Link Software Requirements Specification (SRS).",

Initiation: Any employee can initiate a Problem/Change Request (PCR) using the company's designated form. The initiator must provide a detailed description of the problem or proposed change, identify the affected CIs and baselines, and provide justification for the change.\n2. Logging: The PCR is logged in the central CM tracking system by the CM Manager, who assigns it a unique PCR number.\n3. Evaluation: The Change Control process (Section 5) is triggered to evaluate the proposed change. This includes assessing its technical, cost, schedule, and supportability impacts before being implemented.\n4. Approval: No change to a baselined CI is permitted without an approved PCR. The CCB (Configuration Control Board) ensures that all changes are properly documented, evaluated for impact, and approved before implementation.\n5. Implementation: For approved PCRs, the responsible Engineering Lead develops an implementation plan. Once the change is implemented, it is rigorously tested to verify that it has solved the original problem and has not introduced any unintended side effects.\n6. Verification: The results of this verification are documented and linked to the PCR.\n7. Closure: Once the change has been successfully implemented and verified, the CM Manager formally closes the PCR in the tracking system. This closure includes updating all relevant documentation and establishing a new baseline if required.\n\nIn summary, the process for changing a baselined CI involves initiation of a PCR, logging and evaluation of the proposed change, approval by the CCB, implementation and verification, and finally, closure of the PCR.",
