This principle states that robust controls will be applied to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all information, with specific measures applied to sensitive and classified data in accordance with government and contractual requirements.\n\nThe \"Need-to-Know\" principle will be strictly enforced, which means that only authorized personnel will have access to sensitive or classified information. This principle supports the company's mission as stated in the Corporate Plan by ensuring that confidential and sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.\n\nBy enforcing the \"Need-to-Know\" principle, the company can ensure that its people, information, and assets are safeguarded from a range of security threats, which aligns with the mission to protect the company's capabilities. This principle also supports the company's goal to achieve ISO 27001 certification, as it demonstrates the company's commitment to protecting sensitive information and is a prerequisite for deeper integration into the defence supply chain.",

Evaluation: The Configuration Control Board (CCB) evaluates the PCR to assess its technical, cost, schedule, and supportability impacts.\n4. Approval/Disapproval: The CCB approves or disapproves the PCR based on the evaluation results.\n5. Implementation Plan: For approved PCRs, the responsible Engineering Lead develops an implementation plan.\n6. Implementation: The change is implemented according to the approved plan.\n7. Verification: The change is rigorously tested to verify that it has solved the original problem and has not introduced any unintended side effects.\n8. Documentation: The results of the verification are documented and linked to the PCR.\n9. Closure: Once the change has been successfully implemented and verified, the CM Manager formally closes the PCR in the tracking system.
