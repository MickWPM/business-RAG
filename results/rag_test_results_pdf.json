If the fault persists, raise a Fault Report (FR) (Section: 3).\n2. The FR will be formally documented and tracked using a Defect Report (DR) (Section: 7).\n3. The DR will follow the defect management lifecycle (logging, triage, resolution, verification, closure) defined in SS-TEST-PLAN-001.\n4. If the fault is not resolved, a Non-Conformance Report (NCR) will be submitted according to the process defined in SS-QM-PLAN-001: Quality Management Plan.\n5. The issue will be formally tracked, investigated, and resolved by the appropriate engineering team.\n6. Once the root cause has been identified and fixed, a Defect Report (DR) will be updated to reflect the resolution.\n7. The product will undergo re-testing using the ESS procedure to ensure that the defect is fully resolved.\n\nNote: This process assumes that the failed product is a hardware or software component developed by Synthetic Systems.",

The initiator must provide a detailed description of the problem or proposed change, identify the affected CIs and baselines, and provide justification for the change.\n2. Logging: The PCR is logged in the central CM tracking system by the CM Manager, who assigns it a unique PCR number.\n3. Evaluation: The Change Control Process (Section 5) is used to evaluate the proposed change. This includes assessing its technical, cost, schedule, and supportability impacts.\n4. Approval/Disapproval: The CCB (Configuration Control Board) reviews and approves or disapproves the PCR based on the evaluation results.\n5. Implementation: For approved PCRs, the responsible Engineering Lead develops an implementation plan. Once the change is implemented, it is rigorously tested to verify that it has solved the original problem and has not introduced any unintended side effects.\n6. Verification: The results of this verification are documented and linked to the PCR.\n7. Closure: Once the change has been successfully implemented and verified, the CM Manager formally closes the PCR in the tracking system. This includes updating all relevant documentation and establishing a new baseline if required.\n\nNote that this process is outlined in Section 5 (Configuration Control) of the provided context.",

Conducting a risk assessment and determining the residual risk level.\n2. Identifying that the risk is at the High level, which requires the Head of Operations/Defence Security Committee (DSC) to accept it.\n3.

Watermark: Electronic documents should have a \"PROTECTED\" watermark applied where technically feasible.\n4. Physical Transmission:\n\t* Internal: When carried within Synthetic Systems facilities, classified documents must be concealed in an appropriately marked folder or envelope.\n\t* External (Australia): SECRET documents must be transported by authorized personnel with the appropriate security clearance, using a Defence-approved courier service or escorted by cleared staff. A transit note must be completed and logged in the SECRET Document Register.\n5. Storage: All SECRET documents must be recorded in the company's central SECRET Document Register, managed by the Company Security Officer.\n6. Destruction: When classified information is no longer required, it must be destroyed in a manner that makes reconstruction impossible. For electronic media, this involves using an SCEC-approved degausser or physical destruction device. Simply deleting files is insufficient.\n\nNote that all steps involving SECRET documents require the involvement of cleared personnel and the use of approved procedures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information.",

        "generated_answer": "Based on the provided context, specifically Section 5.1 Part A: Random Vibration, I can answer your question.\n\nThe overall RMS (Root Mean Square) level of the random vibration test profile is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, we can analyze the frequency and power spectral density (PSD) levels to infer the overall RMS level.\n\nAccording to the table in Section 5.1 Part A: Random Vibration, the frequency range is from 20 Hz to 2000 Hz, with a PSD level that varies between -6 dB/octave and +3 dB/octave.\n\nTo estimate the overall RMS level, we can assume an average PSD level across the frequency range. Let's take the average of the minimum and maximum PSD levels: (-6 dB/octave + 3 dB/octave) / 2 = -1.5 dB/octave.\n\nUsing this average PSD level, we can calculate the overall RMS level using the following formula:\n\nRMS = \u221a(\u222b[20 Hz to 2000 Hz] (PSD \u00d7 f) df)\n\nwhere f is the frequency and PSD is the power spectral density.\n\nUnfortunately, without a specific value for the PSD at each frequency point, it's challenging to provide an exact RMS level. However, based on this analysis, we can conclude that the overall RMS level of the random vibration test profile is likely to be relatively low, possibly in the range of 0.1-1.0 g (g = acceleration due to gravity).\n\nPlease note that this estimation is approximate and may not accurately reflect the actual RMS level without more detailed information about the PSD at each frequency point.",
