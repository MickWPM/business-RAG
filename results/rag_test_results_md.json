Basic Troubleshooting: The user attempts to resolve the issue using basic fault finding steps outlined in Section 5.\n2. Non-Conformance Reporting (NCR): If the issue cannot be resolved through basic troubleshooting, the user submits a formal NCR report in accordance with SS-QM-PLAN-001: Quality Management Plan.\n3. Field Service Support: On-site support can be requested through the designated support channel for joint investigation or repair.\n4. Defect Reporting (DR): The issue is formally documented and tracked using a DR, which includes a clear title, detailed description of the issue, steps to reproduce it, expected vs. actual results, and relevant logs or screenshots.\n5. Triage: The DR is reviewed by a board to confirm its validity, assign a priority and severity, and assign it to the appropriate engineering team for investigation.\n6. Resolution: The assigned engineer investigates the defect and implements a fix. The resolution is documented in the DR.\n7. Verification: The Test Engineer re-runs the relevant test case(s) on a new build containing the fix to verify that the defect has been resolved and has not introduced any regressions.\n8. Closure: Once the fix is verified, the DR is formally closed.\n\nThis process ensures that all defects are formally tracked, investigated, and resolved by the appropriate engineering team, as outlined in SS-TEST-PLAN-001, Section 7.",

Impact Assessment: The PCR is assigned to the relevant Engineering Lead(s) for a formal impact assessment. The lead will coordinate with all affected functional areas (e.g., hardware, software, test, logistics) to evaluate the technical feasibility, and potential impacts on cost, schedule, performance, and interoperability.\n3. Evaluation: The findings of this assessment are documented on the PCR form.\n4. Approval: The change request must be approved by the Configuration Control Board (CCB).\n5. Implementation: Once approved, the change is implemented according to the approved plan.\n6. Verification: The changed CI is verified to ensure that it meets the required specifications and standards.\n7. Closure: After successful implementation and verification, the CM Manager formally closes the PCR in the tracking system, updating all relevant documentation and establishing a new baseline if required.\n\nThis process ensures that any change to a baselined CI is properly documented, evaluated for impact, and approved before implementation, as described in Section 5: Configuration Control.",

However, we can infer some requirements from the context.\n\nFrom Section 1 of Document ID: SS-TRI-TEST-001, we know that the purpose of ESS is to precipitate latent defects in hardware by subjecting the Unit Under Test (UUT) to thermal and vibration stresses that exceed its expected operational environment. This implies that the antenna must be able to withstand these stresses without failing.\n\nFrom Section 3 of Document ID: SS-TRI-SPEC-001, we know that the Trident-S Antenna Array is designed for high reliability, low maintenance, and a long service life in a corrosive salt-fog environment. This suggests that the antenna should be able to operate reliably in these conditions.\n\nHowever, without further information or specific requirements stated in the documents, I cannot provide a definitive answer on what exactly constitutes passing the ESS test.
